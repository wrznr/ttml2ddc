# ttml2tei - Convert TTML to TEI XML format

Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) is a [standardized](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml1/) markup language for timed text
which is mainly used for representing subtitles of tv programs when they are offered as internet streams. Subtitles
are a valuable source for language records because they usually reflect characteristics of spoken language and are
available in dimensions otherwise not common for spoken language.

However, TTML is not a very broadly used format in applications used for analyzing or annotating language data.
Since linguists love TEI, this tiny script is supposed to support the use of subtitles in the linguistics domain.
